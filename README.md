<div style="text-align:justify; text-justify">
<p>The knowledge of individual HB energies in molecular clusters is essential for obtaining insights into their physicochemical properties. Albeit there is no direct method available for this purpose. With this in view, a procedure, derived from the fragmentation-based molecular tailoring approach (MTA), has been proposed and extensively applied by Deshmukh and Gadre for directly estimating the individual hydrogen bond (HB) energies and cooperativity contributions in molecular clusters. However, the manual fragmentation and high computational cost of correlated quantum chemical methods make the application of this method to large molecular clusters quite formidable. With this in view, we disseminate in-house developed software for automated hydrogen bond energy estimation (H-BEE) in large molecular clusters. This code exploits our recently developed molecular tailoring approach-based method for HB energy estimation using the actual molecular cluster. The H-BEE code helps the user to overcome the arduous task of manual fragmentation. The code is user-friendly, requires minimal input, and produces the desired output of the HB energies in a tabular format. H-BEE is essentially written in Python and executed on a Linux platform with the Gaussian package at the back end. Two approximations to the MTA-based procedure, viz. the first spherical shell (SS1) and the Fragments-in-Fragments (Frags-in-Frags), enabling cost-effective, automated evaluation of HB energies and cooperativity contributions, are also implemented in this software. The software has been extensively tested on a variety of molecular clusters and is expected to be of immense use, especially in conjunction with correlated methods such as MP2, CCSD(T), and so forth.</p>
